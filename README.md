# elm-multiplication-game
I wanted to try elm and teach my nephew multiplication table.

My first app in elm programming language.
I tried to closely follow model view controller approach.

You have to answer as many multiplication questions as you can.
You start with 10 seconds and for every good answer,
you get additional 1 second.
Wrong answers are not corrected,
they are simply not accepted and you can run out of time.
